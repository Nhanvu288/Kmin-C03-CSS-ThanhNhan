            In software engineering, the terms front end and back end refer to the separation of concerns between the
            presentation layer (front end), and the data access layer (back end) of a piece of software, or the physical
            infrastructure or hardware. In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the front end and
            the server is usually considered the back end, even when some presentation work is actually done on the
            server.
